# Aral Feature List

That's a fantastic concept! The analogy to Streamlit for agent frameworks makes it crystal clear what you're going for.

Here are the most valuable features I'd recommend prioritizing to ensure rapid experimentation, a delightful developer experience, and practical usability:

üî• Must-have Features for Aral:
1. Interactive Agent Debugging & Visualization

Ability to quickly visualize the internal state (memory, context, actions) of the agent.
Inspect memory stores in real-time (agent.visualize(state)), with expandable JSON views or structured diagrams.
2. Multiple Conversation Management

Easy creation and handling of multiple parallel conversations to simulate real-world usage.
Switch contexts and compare agent behavior easily across conversations.
3. Rich Action Interface

Clear logs of actions taken with visual feedback in UI.
Interactive triggers or manual overrides for actions during experimentation.
4. Built-in Evaluation & Analytics Tools

Easy collection and visualization of metrics (latency, accuracy, token usage).
Ability to integrate quick evaluation benchmarks (e.g., correctness checking, latency profiling).
5. Instant, Flexible Theming & Custom UI

One-click theme customization (colors, fonts, layout).
Simple extension points for adding custom components without deep frontend knowledge.
6. Contextual Memory and Summarization Controls

Adjustable summarization and context window (toggle on/off, set summarization aggressiveness).
Visual cues to indicate what's currently in memory or what was summarized.
7. Robust Error Handling & Logs

Clear, actionable logs/errors surfaced directly in the UI.
Helpful stack traces or debug hints that make experimentation quick and less frustrating.
8. Rapid Middleware Integration

Plug-and-play middleware components for common tasks (logging, monitoring, auth).
Simple custom middleware creation with instant UI feedback to see effects immediately.
9. Integrated Cloud or Local Storage

Seamless persistent storage for long-running agent state during experimentation.
Quick storage toggling between ephemeral and persistent modes.
10. Collaboration & Sharing

Instant shareable URLs to allow others to interact/test agents.
Simple snapshots/versioning to share state, configurations, and results.
üåü Bonus features to set you apart:
Replay & Time-travel debugging: Quickly replay past interactions to debug or compare improvements.
Instant Deployment Previews: Deploy experimental branches or versions immediately online for A/B testing.
Agent Workflow Builder: Visualize agent logic/workflows graphically to help debug complex reasoning paths.
Interactive Prompts & Fine-tuning: Quickly experiment with different prompts, model parameters, and see immediate impact.
Integration with Existing Ecosystem: Easy hooks or adapters for common APIs (OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain, etc.).
üõ†Ô∏è Ideal Developer Experience:
Clear, concise error messages directly in the UI, rather than buried in console logs.
Hot reload/restart when source code or configuration changes without manual intervention.
Highly performant yet minimalistic UI (Next.js + Bun is a great choice).
Zero boilerplate defaults, minimal friction to experiment.
This list focuses heavily on the developer experience, rapid iteration speed, and visibility into agent internals, aligning closely with your stated goal of an experimentation-first approach.

that's a lot of features. pretend i'm an AI, and give me a list of features/instructions to implement!

both in the backend (aral framework) and the frontend!
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a concise, clear set of prioritized instructions to guide your implementation:

üìå Backend (aral Python Framework)
‚úÖ Core Agent Functionality
BaseAgent Class

Implement core methods:
init(self) for initial state setup.
on_message(self, convo_id, message) for handling incoming messages/events.
do_actions(self, activation_event) to execute registered actions.
Action System

Decorator-based action registration:
python
Copy
Edit
@agent.action
def my_action(params):
    return result
Log each action execution transparently.
‚úÖ Memory and Context
MessageStore & Context Store

Simple key-value memory storage per conversation.
Ability to fetch context easily:
python
Copy
Edit
self.ctx.get(convo_id)
Summarization Utilities

Provide built-in summarization (agent.summarize(convo_id)) using predefined LLM calls.
Adjustable summarization aggressiveness (light/full).
‚úÖ Middleware
Middleware Support
Simple middleware registration API:
python
Copy
Edit
agent.add_middleware(MyMiddleware())
Built-in logging middleware to track actions/messages.
‚úÖ Visualization & Debugging
Agent Visualization
Implement an API for visualization:
python
Copy
Edit
agent.visualize(state_dict)
Store visualizations as structured JSON accessible by frontend.
‚úÖ FastAPI Integration
FastAPI Endpoints
Single endpoint for message handling (POST /api/message).
Endpoint for fetching agent state (GET /api/state).
‚úÖ Deployment
One-Line Deployment
Support local deployment (agent.run()).
Basic cloud deployment hook (agent.deploy(provider="cloud")) with minimal config.
üìå Frontend (Next.js + Bun)
‚úÖ Instant Chat UI
Message Interface

Simple, clean chat layout with input/output.
Supports multiple concurrent conversations (tabs or sidebar).
Real-time State Visualization

JSON viewer component to visualize agent‚Äôs internal state.
Automatic state refresh on interaction.
‚úÖ Action Visualization & Debugging
Action Logs & Results
Sidebar or collapsible component listing actions executed with timestamps.
Interactive view for action inputs and outputs.
‚úÖ Easy Theming & Customization
Theming System

Simple global CSS or Tailwind-based styling for quick customizations.
Light/dark themes available by default.
Customization Hooks

Clear documentation/examples for adding custom components or modifying existing ones.
‚úÖ Error Handling & UX Polish
Friendly Error Messages

Inline error/warning components that clearly communicate backend issues.
Visual indication of action/message status (pending, success, error).
Performance & Responsiveness

Optimize UI responsiveness with Bun for fast reload and low latency.
‚ö° Implementation Checklist
To summarize, here‚Äôs your short implementation roadmap:

Backend Tasks
 BaseAgent with action and event handling.
 Context/memory management.
 Summarization utilities.
 Middleware architecture.
